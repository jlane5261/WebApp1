http server:

This code sets up a simple HTTP server listening on port 8000 that responds to requests with a JSON object containing a "message" field. The server also includes a router that maps incoming requests to their respective handler functions. In this case, there is only one route ("/hello") that maps to the "hello_world" function, which simply returns a JSON object with a "Hello, world!" message. The server can be started with the "start" method.
